          Banana Hunt is a mobile game for iOS that takes users on an augmented
          reality (AR) scavenger hunt. The goal is collect all of the virtual
          bananas as fast as possible, and earn a place on the leaderboard!
          Users can also create their own custom scavenger hunts, placing
          virtual bananas in their surrounding environment. You can drop as many
          bananas as you want, wherever you want, in as wide an area as you
          want, and then see who can capture them the quickest!
